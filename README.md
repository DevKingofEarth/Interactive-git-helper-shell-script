# About this project

This is an interactive script to manage your projects may it be local, cloned or connected to remotes of multiple git platforms. It helps you navigate and handle some solutions or preparations before you commit or push in your considered git platforms or networks as well as clone any Repositories. It eases your workflow by making workflows interactive. This can also be integrated with other solutions and platforms as much as possible.


# Directions of use

1. Documentations you can use;

- Code Documentation : for debugging or easy understanding of script
- User Manual : to understand and ease of use for Interactions with the script.
- Also refer platform.conf for your setup.
- View below diagrams for easy visualization, but there might be mistakes, which will also be resolved gradually.

2. Prequisites of knowledge
- Small basics about git
- Small understandin about personal/organisation tokens from various platforms
- Small SSH basics
- Documentations
- BASH scripting basics to know and beware of the script
